    My name is Daniel and I am currently studying Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NYU.
    I'm primarily interested in scale-up and catalysis processes - essentially various means to
    aid in the mass production of materials. Another one of my interests is energy: its generation
    and its storage. For renewables, my main interest is in solar cells because of all the chemical
    processes used in production. The field of solar energy is very much intertwined with the
    principles of scale-up, which is great. For non-renewable (but clean) energy, I'm interested
    in nuclear power. It's incredibly inexpensive, quite safe, and unfortunately all too neglected
    nowadays. There's still so much that can be done in the field, but sadly it's been largely
    dormant outside of academic circles since Chernobyl (and followed by Fukushima).

    At the moment I'm studying the Quantum Chemistry part of Physical Chemistry, as well as Linear
    Algebra and Differential Equations. My projects are often reflective of what I'm learning at
    the moment, so as time goes on, the variety within my projects will grow.

    About me - for real this time. I'm a deist with (I like to think) a strong moral compass. I'm
    always interested in expanding my horizons by learning new things, especially in the realms
    outside my college studies. I'm about equal parts theoretician and experimentalist, which comes
    in handy when working on my projects.
