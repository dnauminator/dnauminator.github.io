    <details><summary>A Zenful Approach to MATLAB</summary><span>
    A lot of my friends and acquaintances in university have come to me wanting to 'get' MATLAB.
    Typically, they are frustrated that their hours-long debugging has been extremely lackluster,
    and failed to solve the problem. This is only further exacerbated by decently tight deadlines
    on homework, which puts further stress on getting the homework done on time.

    My approach to MATLAB has (in my view) been pretty successful. I don't have any qualms with
    the language (aside from a few quirks) and generally don't spend too much time on debugging.
    I think the longest amount of time I've spent on fixing my code (initially typing it is a
    whole different story that I'll get to later) took around half an hour. I think that some may
    find my approach helpful in their own endeavors with the language, so here's the way I do it:

    First and foremost, you want to record the mistakes you made previously. MATLAB is very nitpicky
    especially on syntax, and I've fixed a lot of my programs by noticing that I didn't put a '*'
    between a number and a variable. When something in a new code doesn't work, I know what to check
    for first. A checklist approach to possible errors can really cut down on the time you spend on
    debugging. 

    Second, use old code that works as a reference point. You might be writing a ordinary differential
    equation script and for some reason it just isn't working. If it's your first time doing that, use 
    online resources such as MATLAB documentation. The second, third, fourth, etc. time around, if an
    error pops up in a similar ODE function you're programming, use your first code that works to
    figure out what's tripping MATLAB up. To do this most effectively, you need well-structured code.

    Third, write well-structured code. You don't need to put comments on every line, but you should
    know what every block of your code is doing. This will save you a lot of time in debugging, because
    it can really narrow down your list on what might've gone wrong. Also, this'll allow other people
    (which includes your peers and your graders) to understand your code as well, which is helpful to
    them. 

    Fourth, reduce and reuse are very helpful. Many of the problems you might solve can be lumped into
    categories, such as fsolve problems, ODE problems, and PDE problems. If you have template code for
    these core problems you might encounter, the likelihood you will have a difficult debugging experience
    in the first place becomes unlikely.

    Hope this was helpful, and best of luck in your MATLAB projects.

    <details><summary>Rough Waves in a Perfect Storm: What Lies in Roblox's Future</summary><span>
  This is an optimistic and market-minded case study that I've written for a Engineering Writing and 
  Entrepreneurship class.

  Multiplayer games have become ubiquitous in the video game industry since the 1990s,
  and their popularity has only grown since then. Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying 
  Games (or MMORPG for short) were a massive hit, with games such as World of Warcraft, 
  released in 2004, still being popular to this day. Roblox was also created in 2004, by engineering 
  entrepreneurs David Bazucki and Erik Cassel, who initially developed it as a sandbox physics 
  engine. Roblox debuted in 2006 to a limited audience, and slowly gained popularity over the 
  years, with the pandemic further hastening the snowball-like growth of the company. While the 
  company has undoubtedly benefited from the pandemic and savvy financial decisions, they now 
  face a slew of challenges ranging from scrutiny into their virtual currency and marketplaces, to 
  mounting pressure from the platform's game developers to increase payouts. Additionally, the 
  lifting of pandemic restrictions has caused a slowdown in daily user growth. However, by nature 
  of being a well-established player with many income streams and minimal outside competition, 
  Roblox has a multitude of options that they can pursue to solve the problems at hand and 
  continue their growth, albeit at a slightly slower pace than during the pandemic. To better 
  understand these challenges and how to best address them, one should take a closer look at the 
  building blocks of Roblox.

  Roblox has two key supports that made it successful as a destination for game players and game 
  developers - a robust physics engine that is now eighteen years in the making, and its 
  game-hosting service. The physics engine is the structural backbone of every Roblox game, with 
  the code governing player and object motion. Its complexity allows for the large variety of 
  games that Roblox hosts. The hosting service is self-explanatory: users can join each other's 
  games by connecting to the host server of those games from their devices. Combined, these 
  features allow users of the platform to both create, host, and play games all within Roblox's 
  virtual environment. While the Roblox team organizes events and occasionally releases games, a 
  vast majority of the games on the platform are created by its users. During Roblox's early days, 
  game developers were rewarded with virtual currencies that could only be used to buy cosmetics 
  from the Roblox marketplace, or gamepasses for other games on the platform. This virtual 
  currency could also be purchased with dollars. This radically changed in 2013, when a feature 
  called Developer Exchange (DevEx for short) was introduced to the community. This allowed 
  developers to "cash this amount out at $100.00 USD" with a cap set at "500,000 ROBUX (or 
  $500.00 USD)" ("Roblox Blog"). This allowed developers of especially popular games to earn 
  real money from the games they made. Since 2013, the DevEx program has become much 
  friendlier to developers, with 100,000 ROBUX now exchanging for $350.00 USD. While for the 
  initial iteration of DevEx developers needed to have an expensive Roblox membership (costing 
  around $20 per month), as of two months ago users can exchange ROBUX for dollars without 
  any sort of membership requirement ("Roblox DevForum"). This has helped spur Roblox's game 
  development scene. The exchange mainly benefits the creators of relatively popular games, and 
  accumulating 100,000 ROBUX from game development is no easy task. However, with the 
  increase of payout rates as well as the amount of users participating in the DevEx system and the 
  ever increasing cost of hosting so many games and players on their servers, Roblox's net income 
  has been in the negatives. A further increase in DevEx rates would only exacerbate the mounting 
  costs of operations. Generally, despite Roblox's leaps and bounds in revenue over the past four 
  years, their earnings have been negative and decreasing. 

  Another problem that Roblox faces is the increased scrutiny their cosmetic market place is 
  experiencing as a result of some tradable, collectible items. The direct purchase of ROBUX is a 
  significant revenue stream for the company, in part due to users using this currency to buy those 
  cosmetics for their virtual character. As brought up in the People Make Games follow up video, 
  the limited collectibles market is problematic, as it easily allows impulsive and costly purchases 
  with no effective way to undo any poor decisions made in the moment. Additionally, with every 
  purchase made in the limited collectibles market, Roblox takes a 30% cut, which makes up yet 
  another revenue stream for the corporation ("People Make Games"). The increased scrutiny 
  definitely has its place, and it is on Roblox's shoulders to decide how to improve their virtual 
  marketplace to make it more restrictive and safe, while not significantly cutting into their profits. 
  The People Make Games video takes too extreme of a stance against the marketplace, though, 
  and doesn't acknowledge that much of the massive rise in item prices is due to the large influx of 
  new players willing to buy them. This rapid growth has also led to several other problems 
  touched upon in the video, such as scams and even black markets - things that Roblox should 
  crack down on, both for user safety and for public relations. However, the marketplace has been 
  around since before the DevEx system, and a case could be made that some of the market items 
  are an iconic part of Roblox's image. Therefore, a massive overhaul of it could do more harm 
  than good, both to the active members of the collectible community and to Roblox's bottom line. 

  A final and important problem that Roblox faces is the end of the pandemic. The company has 
  grown significantly during the pandemic, with Roblox financial news reporting a 32% year over 
  year increase in daily active users in January 2022 ("Roblox News"). Likewise, large increases in 
  year-over-year revenue and hours engaged were reported. With pandemic restrictions being lifted 
  around the world, Roblox's growth has slowed down and as a result, its stock has plummeted. A 
  quote from Roblox CEO David Bazucki in a February 2022 Yahoo Finance article reads "As 
  parts of the world began to return to a more normal way of life, our absolute numbers have 
  continued to grow… [but] growth rates have declined as we are comparing, in some cases, to 
  quarters last year in which certain key metrics doubled or even nearly tripled" (D'Anastasio). 
  This drop in stock price implies a lack of confidence among investors in the direction Roblox is 
  headed after the pandemic is over, as well as skepticism about Roblox's endeavors in the 
  metaverse. However, this may have been a market overreaction. The stock has stabilized at 
  around $50 per share - slightly lower than its initial IPO and considerably lower than its peak 
  after Q3 earnings beat expectations, but a reasonable adjustment for a company that was able to 
  grow much faster during the pandemic than it would have otherwise.

  Before delving into the options Roblox has to mitigate the problems at hand, it is also important 
  to understand what they've been working on and investing in, to both better understand their 
  market operations and their future trajectory. First of all, Roblox has rightly invested into a 
  robust server-side system that keeps the site, the games, and the game servers up and running. 
  They've collaborated with HashiCorp, a cloud computing company that aided Roblox in first 
  setting up this large system back in 2018. Back then, "Roblox has deployed Nomad on 11,000+ 
  nodes in 20 clusters across bare metal and cloud — serving 100 million MAUs [Monthly Active 
  Users] in 200+ countries with 99.995 percent uptime" (HashiCorp). Now with 54 million daily 
  active users, it follows that Roblox and HashiCorp have expanded their operation, which has 
  caused a significant portion of the rising operation costs. Those costs are necessary though, as 
  the near-constant uptime and robustness of the servers are the backbone of the company, 
  especially as it grows larger through its expansion into foreign markets. 

  A second big investment for Roblox has been the metaverse, which also is one of the few places 
  where the company may encounter significant competition. However unlike Meta, the elephant 
  in the room when discussing the metaverse, Roblox's focus is not augmented or virtual reality. 
  "AR/VR might not be all that necessary to create immersion" says Craig Donato, a chief 
  business officer at Roblox, in a December 2021 Morning Brew article. "When you read a lot 
  about metaverses in the press, I think we naturally gravitate toward immersion being the 
  problem. Like, 'Oh, we need VR and AR, and that's when it's going to really take hold.' I think 
  that we've already kind of hit the tipping point for immersion. What I would say, though, is that 
  there's an incredible amount of innovation that still needs to occur on the social side" (Morning 
  Brew). This clears up Roblox's recent acquisitions of Loom.ai and Guilded, a virtual avatar and 
  online community startup respectively. It seems that Roblox's vision for the metaverse is a more 
  immersive experience within the already existing framework the company has built. Instead of 
  opting to create a greater visual immersion by means of VR or AR, Roblox is seeking to improve 
  as a social platform - a logical step considering their large active user base. 

  The third path that Roblox has been paving for their future is that of advertising and 
  collaboration with celebrities. While this has been done for a long time on the small scale 
  (largely NERF and Lunchables partnerships), Roblox's jump in popularity has given it more 
  power in negotiating advertisements, as well as a more attractive means of advertisement. A 
  November 2021 Heller House article discusses a Roblox presentation to investors about 
  advertising on the platform. "Brands have been on the platform for many years. And when they 
  first came on, they created virtual items or branded missions and scavenger hunts to integrate 
  into existing experiences" says VP of Brand Partnerships Christina Wootton. "Many of the 
  [brands] started to come on and they saw engagement numbers they've never seen before. And 
  now we have so much demand" (Heller House). Heller House likens Gucci's and Cartoon 
  Network's advertising forays into Roblox to MasterCard's forays into a 2004 Facebook. On a 
  tangential note, recently Apple enabled a privacy policy that "Facebook parent Meta said…will 
  decrease the social media company's sales this year by about $10 billion" (Leswing). Advertisers 
  on Facebook will inevitably be hurt by this too. It seems that Roblox is well equipped to further 
  expand into the realm of hosting advertisements, although much like with their marketplace, they 
  will have to take special care to ensure that it is not predatory. Heller House states that Roblox 
  has a very competitive cost per click and cost per play compared to more established advertisers 
  - almost 100x less. Additionally, advertising itself is very different in Roblox than it is on 
  Facebook, Amazon, and other internet hubs. So far, advertising has come not in the form of 
  ingame billboards or excessive pop ups on the front page of the popular games tab. Instead, a 
  special strategy oriented on creating "Experiences" (Roblox's term for games) that are also 
  advertisements has been prevalent. Gucci's inroads into Roblox were in the form of virtual items 
  in the marketplace and a game showcasing a garden and articles of clothing. This synthesis of 
  games and advertising is novel and its effect on sales is not yet entirely clear, but it seems like a 
  better alternative to in-your-face pop ups and garish billboards in virtual worlds. A large 
  audience and a cheap advertising platform, Heller House concludes, means that Roblox could 
  become the next hub of marketing and online advertising, which would signal the creation of a 
  large, novel stream of revenue.

  So, keeping in mind the problems Roblox faces as well as their various present endeavors, what 
  good options does Roblox have to further their success? One way Roblox may continue on is to 
  carry on with their status quo, which is to slowly develop all of their projects listed earlier. It 
  seems likely that advertising will be a very significant revenue stream for Roblox, and they've 
  already partnered with some very notable brands, like Gucci and Warner Bros. This will help 
  alleviate investor pains about negative earnings over time. Similarly, furthering Roblox as a 
  metaverse could help increase engagement with the platform, which ties back to advertising. 
  More time spent on Roblox would mean ads are viewed more, resulting in more revenue both for 
  Roblox's users and the company itself. Additionally, this slow fiscal expansion could alleviate 
  the tension caused by developer exchange, with higher fiscal profits by Roblox potentially 
  signaling higher payouts for the platform's game developers. However, the time span is unclear 
  here, and while this approach might work in the long run, a few more bad quarterly earnings 
  reports and possibly a drop in daily active users due to the lifting of pandemic restrictions could 
  be very bad news. It might mean that Roblox would have to downsize its operation or risk losing 
  even more money, and while this scenario is unlikely, it is still a possibility. The approach also 
  fails to really address the issues with the marketplace, and for a company the size of Roblox, not 
  all press is good press.

  A second option Roblox has is to expand as an educational program, which is something briefly 
  touched upon in the Four Week MBA article as Roblox's vision for the metaverse. After all, 
  Roblox is built on the foundations of a complex physics engine, and programming for games is 
  done in Lua, which makes the platform's use as an educational tool very useful. This 
  education-first approach would require that the website be made safer, and special care should be 
  taken to improve the marketplace and to try and dissolve any sort of black market. Roblox's asset 
  as an educational tool cannot be understated, and several games centered around teaching users 
  the Lua programming language already exist. It is not far-fetched to imagine a Roblox staff-held 
  competition for the creation of educational games. This approach will result in a safer website 
  overall, as well as more user engagement, as a few schools may adopt this new, virtual curricula, 
  especially for subjects like physics where the 3D virtual environment can be conducive to 
  learning. However, there are a couple of issues that plague this educational approach. Making the 
  website much safer runs the risk of compromising the up and coming advertising revenue stream. 
  Additionally, it heavily relies on the collaboration of schools with this program. Just because 
  educational games and physics simulators can exist on the platform does not mean that people 
  will flock to them, and this could hamper revenue.

  Finally, Roblox could go for an age-tiered system for its users and ramp up on advertising, as 
  well as allow for a greater diversity of games. This is something that Roblox has been working 
  towards, but it is unclear if they are willing to follow through with it. In an October 2021 
  Tekdeeps article, the initial steps that Roblox has taken in this direction are laid out: "Roblox 
  reported this month that for the first time, more than half of its audience is over 13. The company 
  recently announced new tools that aim to bring older users to the platform. Among them: more 
  realistic avatars; the ability to restrict access to games for children under 13 or even 17 years old; 
  voice chats available to those over 13. To verify your age, you can upload a photo of yourself 
  with a government-issued ID" (Tekdeeps). This separation between Roblox's younger and older 
  players could allow Roblox to take a more aggressive approach in regards to advertising and 
  relieve scrutiny from the collectible items market. By restricting younger audiences from 
  impulse trading valuable collectibles and some forms of advertising while ramping it up for older 
  users, a sweet spot between safety and revenue can be reached. The addition of voice chat also 
  furthers the idea of a Roblox metaverse, and promotes player interaction. Ultimately, this age tier 
  system can result both in a safer and more profitable Roblox, as well as further Roblox's 
  endgame goal of becoming a social metaverse. However, this scenario might cause problems 
  within the playerbase, and if done improperly could cause an exodus from the platform. Too 
  many restrictions on younger users or too much advertising towards older users could result in 
  dwindling player numbers. The room for error is low.

  I believe that with a competent staff team and proper leadership, the best choice for Roblox is the 
  third, despite the potential risk it poses. Roblox has already made strides towards it, and it seems 
  that the logical conclusion to their latest actions is precisely what the third option entails. While 
  some aspects of separating out age groups may be difficult to implement, it is a safe way to 
  increase profits while making the platform safer as a whole. Additionally, it has the promise of a 
  more interactive online experience, as evidenced by the introduction of the voice chat. While 
  some players may dislike the changes the implementation of the third option may bring, I believe 
  that the long term advantages to that approach outweigh the negatives. Finally, the tiered age 
  system can help Roblox develop into something much greater than a game creation and hosting 
  service. There's already been instances of the game development platform being used for interior 
  design creation, and it is not hard to imagine Roblox becoming a place to host one's design 
  portfolio in the future. This diversification could help Roblox maintain its long term relevance, 
  and the tiered age system might help foster a more job-oriented community of users on the 
  platform. It is also likely that Roblox may just stick to the status quo though, and with some luck 
  they will enter the post-pandemic era much stronger than they entered. While a “boring" option, 
  they have a large enough user base and enough inertia due to the massive influx of new users to 
  survive and maybe thrive without any major overhauls. However, the perfect storm and rough 
  waves persist, and we will have to wait and see what Roblox chooses to do, and how it ends up.

    <details><summary>What Makes Humans Human?</summary><span>
    I've seen many conversations about what differentiates humans from other animals and other homonid
    species, and I wanted to posit a hypothesis that I've been mulling over for the better part of two
    years. I believe that humans are unique because of their ability to take risks and put themselves
    in disadvantageous situations with no clear benefit. Simply put, the ultimate human trait is
    irrationality to the point of it being bold and in-your-face. However, there are certain nuances
    to this argument that are important to understand before I delve in.

    First and foremost, not all humans are like this. It's very easy to live your life as a rational
    being, to settle into a routine and to live a predictable life. In fact, most people do live their
    lives this way, and this isn't particularly a bad thing. We've cultivated the seeds of society by
    tilling fields, not by setting off in a raft across a massive sea in search of something. We've
    built major cities generation by generation - in some places in East Asia, you can find family-owned
    businesses that trace their roots hundreds, maybe even a thousand years back. And this legacy of
    being able to stay in place and grow, much like a tree, is impressive on its own.

    But the seeds of society and our civilization do not spread slowly and methodically, and we do not,
    for the most part, just grow in place. Human irrationality has also created incredible mobility.
    We see this in history - human migration. Why did humans move into places that they could've
    reasonably predicted would be tougher to survive. What drove people across the far northern
    East Russia - Alaska land bridge? Perhaps it was the hunt, but I doubt that is the only reason. Nor
    would be the many excursions of the Polynesians, who set out to colonize the South Pacific, even
    with the risk of their ship not hitting any shore but instead the ocean floor. 

    A common theory as to why Neanderthals never achieved parity with Homo sapiens is due to the risk-
    taking nature of us humans. We have sailed through dangerous waters and thus found greener pastures.
    And since the 20th century (though certainly before then as well) we've begun to tackle seemingly
    unassailable challenges. The reason we've traversed both poles and climbed the tallest peaks of the
    continents? Prestige. Hardly something rational, considering the dangerous task at hand. It's not a
    noble either. The "because it's there" attitude is something that is uniquely human, uniquely Homo
    sapien. 

    Perhaps other species dream, have consciousness, are rational and smart. I can't exactly prove it to
    you. Scientists have revealed that there are species that have complex social hierarchies, networks 
    as global as our own (ants are a good example of this). But I am hardpressed to find any that try to 
    assail the unassailable simply because it can. That, I believe, is a uniquely human trait.

    postscriptum - Perhaps this irrationality and "because I can" attitude that humans possess is one of
    the great "hurdles" of intelligent and sentient alien life. It's not too unlikely to imagine aliens
    with great techonlogy and a worldwide mega-city who never really bother moving outwards, simply because
    they lack what we have.

    <details><summary>A Mixed Bag: Introspection and analysis of what makes a good engineer</summary><span>
    A short essay written for a recent writing class. Relevant (and in my opinion, good enough) to share
    
    Reading Ian Bogost's 2015 article "Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers" has made me 
    reexamine what exactly makes a good engineer, and to look at the qualities I have that I believe 
    will be vital to my career. Bogost places the title of engineer upon a towering pedestal, and 
    underscores its importance. Specifically, the use of engineering as a means of completing or 
    contributing to a monumental task that has a sizable impact on our lives. I believe that when 
    Bogost envisions engineering feats, he thinks of the Roman aqueducts, or the mass production of 
    ammonium fertilizer. "Engineering claims an explicit responsibility to public safety and 
    reliability, even if it doesn't always deliver. (2)" This, I believe, is the core tenet of 
    engineering as a real-world discipline. The structures we build, the inventions we patent, should 
    be robust, thought out, and built to last. This is critical because if it were not so, the world 
    around us would be unreliable and dangerous, with no guarantee of safety. So, the main job of the 
    engineer is not just to create and to contribute to the world of the future, but also to ensure 
    that this world does not rapidly fall apart. Bogost takes an extreme approach with regards to 
    ensuring reliability and starts pointing fingers at the tech industry and Silicon Valley. 
    "..the technology industry can 'engineerwash' - leveraging the legacy of engineering...to engender 
    trust, competence, and service in the public interest." Bogost is right to point out the recent 
    shortcomings of software engineering: he mentions a couple of data breaches, the bricking of 
    iPhones, and what he perceives as the "release and then fix" mentality that would simply not work 
    in other engineering fields (at least, according to him). It is the "fix later" mentality and how 
    it is at odds with one of the key tenets of engineering - reliability, that is the core of Bogost's 
    anti-software-engineering sentiment. It also underscores Bogost's ignorance of iterative design, and 
    it seems as if he believes that the result of every engineering endeavor should be a finished 
    product - stamped with the seal of "this will work." However, this is seldom the case in any 
    engineering field.

    Bogost's hardline approach to software engineering and his disdain for the people within it is where I 
    draw the line, as he allows his ignorance in prototyping lead him to make "in-bad-faith" conclusions and 
    generalizations about the people in the field. Software engineering is difficult, especially when 
    establishing use cases. When civil engineers construct a bridge, it is clear that it'll be used by either 
    cars or pedestrians. Possibly, it could be used by trains. But that's just three use cases, and thus the 
    main focus of those engineers is to figure out the optimal balance between construction cost and 
    structural integrity, not how someone can try and break the bridge. Software engineers have to account 
    for the misuse of their product by the end user, a task that is surprisingly difficult. A jokey metaphor 
    for this is an engineer who creates a bar, then walks into it and orders 1 beer, 0 beers, -1 beers, 999… 
    beers, and so on, and everything works. When a customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is, the bar 
    bursts into flames. This separation between developer and end user is why the software industry can never 
    really let go of "release and then fix." Additionally, the software developers have to worry about things 
    such as cybersecurity, especially if they're working for a corporation that stores sensitive data. (Most) 
    civil engineers don't particularly worry about having their bridge blown up, but software engineers have 
    to consider the possible data breaches that malicious third parties can do on their site - more user 
    misuse cases. To release an unbreaking piece of software is a near impossible task, and one that would 
    take many years to develop in the first place. I believe that iterative design, something that Bogost seems 
    to disdain especially in software, is one of the most important parts of engineering. It's not just for 
    small-scale prototyping either - after the I-35W bridge collapsed in Minneapolis and the cause was determined 
    to be inadequate load capacity due to gusset plates that were too small (National Transportation Safety Board), 
    many similar bridges were inspected and for some, that same issue was found and fixed. A sort of way to update 
    the bridge. Being able to build a robust system to begin with is excellent, but the ability to revise it and 
    improve it as time goes on is more important, both in the physical and digital worlds.

    Ultimately, my engineering values are focused around both the creation of a system built to last and being 
    able to update and improve the system as time passes, as well as to constantly ideate and experiment on a 
    small scale. As a future chemical engineer, safety is paramount, and I intend for my approaches to problems in 
    this field to have a thoughtful and adaptable safety-first approach. When I will design the chemical reactors 
    of the future, it is vital that they actually contribute to that future - an impossible task without meticulous 
    preplanning. It is my responsibility to make sure the professional projects I work on contribute positively to 
    society. However, not all endeavors can be this vast and important. I am a believer in the ideals of rapid 
    prototyping, especially with all the amazing tools engineers have at their disposal, as it allows one to set an 
    engineering idea into motion very easily. While Bogost may not like it, sometimes, engineering is doing some 
    testing on Fusion 360 and then 3D printing a cool new part into existence without the "it shall work for years" 
    mentality. It can always be improved and revised later. Sometimes, robust design and engineering conflict, 
    sometimes, it is necessary that they work together. Both will help shape the world of the future.

    <details><summary>What Led to the End of 'Old Roblox'?</summary><span>
    There's always been a debate as to when old roblox died. Some people argue that it was when the
    forums were removed. Others claim that it was far, far before, and that old roblox died back in
    2012 when all these "new players" started showing up. I would argue, though, that the killing
    blow to old roblox and the replacement of good-natured fun by generic corporatism happened with
    the removal of Tix, or Tickets.

    So what is a Tix? Many people who are newer to roblox have either never heard of them or have
    heard it mentioned in passing and given it no thought. After all, the boom of roblox can be
    traced as starting at 2018, when plans for an IPO started to be drawn up and well after Tix
    were in their proverbial graveyard. Tix were an alternate currency to Robux, and acted as a
    means to purchase unique items and had a variable exchange system into Robux.

    To make things clear before I delve deeper, the death of Tix was inevitable. Tix were based off
    visits to one's game by other people - one per (unique?) player who joined the world you had
    created. This was a good incentive to create fun games - people visit, you get paid, everyone
    wins. Towards 2015 and moreso 2016, people figured out ways to farm Tix, and that basically
    spelled "the end" for the venerable currency. It, of course, was removed under the guise of
    "confusion for new users." Now, its Robux only.

    This actually isn't the only reason Tix are gone. Roblox always wishes for a monopoly on the
    currency exchange, they impose a 30% tax on any sort of sale. Tix were a way to bypass this,
    because you could exchange them into Robux and back without paying that cut. And now, Roblox
    has their monopoly, and with a speculative, red-hot limited items market (that has simply
    staggering volumes of exchange) their profits are massive. Naturally, this has had ramifications.
    These ramifications, I believe, are one of the main reasons old roblox vanished.

    Nowadays, developers are incentivized by a system called "Developer Exchange," or DevEX for
    short. It's an exchange system of robux into cash, and it rewards game developers who create
    popular games. But it also incentivizes a pay-to-win (or at the very least, freemium) type of
    game. This is so blatantly obvious today, where the front page is saturated with games that
    have too many gamepasses, most of them cheap enough that you only need a single $4.99 purchase
    of 400 robux - "it's just 5 dollars, it can't hurt." The Roblox game scene is severely lacking
    in good, entirely free to play, fun games. There's simply no incentive to do it outside of a
    passion project. 

    This is not to say that all the games on the front page are bad. There are some that you can
    certainly play and enjoy without spending any money. But now, they're few and far between.
    So, the death of Tix pretty much marked the end of the "play to have fun, not to fill our
    pockets." Not to say that people didn't fill their pockets before, but nowadays, if your dream
    is to create the next big thing on Roblox and translate that success into real life, you might
    have to.

    <details><summary>What the Future Holds</summary><span>
    This website, at least the backbone structure of it, is basically complete. It holds the things
    I publish and share, has some nice navigable menus - one can argue that it is finished - only
    the informative parts of it shall be updated. However, this isn't true, and I wanted to discuss
    with you, my readers, my greater plans for dnauminator.xyz and what I intend to do here.

    Sure, first and foremost this site is a compilation of notes. School notes on subjects that I
    find interesting and engaging. The site's purpose in the future, though, will be something more
    important - my ONLY internet porch. Over the next couple of months I intend to decouple myself
    from the runaway train of social media for two primary reasons - my studies and my future
    wellbeing. Of course, with this departure from a myriad of sites, it'll be hard to keep in
    touch with the people who stay on them, so I intend to expand this site to include a private
    messaging system or a forum to those who want to talk.

    My vision for this forum is sort of two-fold. People email me saying they want to join the forum,
    I think on it, and decide if they're in or not. If you're approved, thats fold 1 - you get to
    talk to me directly on my website. But that's just direct messaging - one of my fondest memories
    of the internet come from group forums. It's the main appeal of places like Discord that have all
    but replaced this unfortunately dying system. So, I intend for there to also be a public forum
    for approved members - threads where friends and I can discuss anything and everything.

    I intend to release this forum update either during spring break or some time in the middle of
    May, since I have to create not just a forum but a secure login system for approved users. Should
    be a fun programming project though, and I'll keep you guys posted. :-)
