    <a href="https://friesian.com/">Kelley L. Ross</a> is a prolific writer, especially in the fields of psychology and history. His
    analysis of American Presidents is particularly interesting and a focal point of many a
    discussion. Odds are I might write some responses to his analyses in the near future.

    <a href="https://www.scaruffi.com/">Piero Scaruffi</a> is another writer, and a polymath with a staggering array of knowledge. His 
    writings on films and music alone are vast and insightful, not to mention that a lot of his 
    work is still not translated to english. From tech to politics to the arts, he has something 
    published on the matter.
