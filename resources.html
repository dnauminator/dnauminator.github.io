    Prolific Writers and Grand Ideas:
    <a href="https://friesian.com/">Kelley L. Ross</a> is a prolific writer, especially in the fields of psychology and history. His
    analysis of American Presidents is particularly interesting and a focal point of many a
    discussion. Odds are I might write some responses to his analyses in the near future.

    <a href="https://www.scaruffi.com/">Piero Scaruffi</a> is another writer, and a polymath with a staggering array of knowledge. His 
    writings on films and music alone are vast and insightful, not to mention that a lot of his 
    work is still not translated to english. From tech to politics to the arts, he has something 
    published on the matter.

    <a href="https://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a> is a software developer and notable screensaver creator. He runs an active 
    blog and posts various cool software and real-life projects on it. The list of software is 
    vast, interesting, and crucially, public. A must visit if you're a fan of Netscape and 
    Mozilla Firefox.

    Blogs and Websites of Interesting People:
    -- People in my "web-ring" --
    <a href="https://castlebravo.neocities.org">CastleBravo</a> is an internet acquaintance and a man with many interests. I'm excited to see 
    how his website and the content on it develops :-). His internet travel directory is a nice 
    websurfing port.
