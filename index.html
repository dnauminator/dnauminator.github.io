    I'm Daniel, a Chemical Engineering major at NYU, and am interested in chemistry, data science, software development, and philosophy.
    Welcome to my <a href="musings.html">updated</a> site. In the blog there are several categories by which I split up the things I write.
    'Musings' is for some of my trains of thought or shorter works. 'What I Learned' is academic-focused and effectively me processing the 
    knowledge from (text)books and research articles. 'Writings' are longer pieces that I've written either for a class or just 
    for fun, and are written more formally (i.e citations, bibliography, the like).<br><br>
    As some may remember from the old site, there was also a Layman's List for summarized class notes. As my classes have gotten more
    intense in their use of variables (and in note quantity), I have found it difficult to keep up. Expect Layman List-style content to
    be posted in 'What I Learned' instead.
