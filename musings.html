    <details><summary>A Revamped Website (08/22/2023)</summary><span>
        Today is August 22nd, 2023. I've been slowly working on this new, revamped website for around a month, and it's finally good enough to 
        start being something that I can show off. I've gone for a more minimalistic design, and focused more on quality of life features, such 
        as a more legible font, better mobile compatibility, and more straightforward site navigation.<br><br>
        
        Some of you may be sad to see the old site go. It hasn't gone anywhere - just click "dnauminator" in the top left, then "Retro Site" in 
        the top right. However, it will no longer be receiving updates - expect new publications, projects, and other endeavors to end up on the 
        new site instead. You may also be interested as to why the domain name has changed. First and foremost, Github Pages hosts this site for 
        free, which is great. Second, it makes pushing updates to the site much easier for me to do from any device, whereas for the old domain, 
        I would have to do all pushes from my laptop.<br><br>
    
        Expect more content here soon! -dnauminator
