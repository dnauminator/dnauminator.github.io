    <details><summary><u>Engineering and Positive Psychology (06/29/2023)</u></summary><span>
        In many ways, positive psychology and (idealistic) engineering both strive for the same goals. In one way or another, their focus is to improve our quality of life, and to advance flourishing in our world. 
        Engineering has contributed to making our lives easier with its focus on solving real-world problems and innovation. Groundbreaking advancements have been made in the field, shaping our modern world, and 
        addressing complex challenges. However, the pursuit of technical excellence has had the adverse effect of neglecting the human element; which is consequential considering the field's worldwide impact. 
        Historically, the field has left little room for the consideration of well-being, humanism, and ethical practice and design. As the fields of engineering and engineering education evolve, the benefits of 
        implementing the principles of positive psychology become more evident. By emphasizing well-being and human prosperity, and cultivating positive traits and experiences, we can unlock a range of benefits that 
        go beyond (and contribute to) technical proficiency. We can apply positive psychology to attain various benefits: fostering creativity and innovation, enhancing teamwork by building stronger relationships, 
        and attaining humane ethical practices. Positive psychology can also build resilience: get us better equipped to tackle the difficult current and future challenges. <br><br>

	    The path to implementing positive psychology in engineering begins in engineering education; however, mental health research in engineering education is a recent development, and the studies on positive mental 
        health interventions in the field are even more limited. One pilot study at Arizona State University implemented and encouraged mindfulness-based conventions in the undergraduate student body through a short 
        workshop. At the end of the class, “42 students wrote that they had the intention of integrating contemplative practices like mindfulness meditation more in their lives” and when asked about participating in a 
        more in-depth workshop next year, “47 said yes…[indicating] that the majority of students…were interested in learning more” (Asghar & Minichiello, 2023, p. 7). Bringing in concepts of wellness, mindfulness, and 
        thriving into engineering education can help the next generation of engineers be more resilient as well. It is inspiring to see that research in mental health and positive psychology is making inroads into the 
        field and into the curriculum in the form of workshops. <br><br>
        
	    Another integral part of engineering education that can implement positive psychology is engineering ethics. While not always directly aligned with the current model of moral and preventative ethics, including 
        positive psychology can result in beneficial outcomes. There is good reason for ethics to focus on minimizing risk (due to engineering disasters and their significant environmental and social impact), but Charles 
        Harris argues that "'aspirational ethics,' namely the use of professional knowledge to promote the human good,” (Harris, 2008, p. 155) should have their place in engineering ethics. This can rekindle a humanistic 
        approach in professional practice, in the sense that engineering is not just rules that need to be abided by, but virtues that should be aspired to. Harris also states that a virtue such as “sensitivity to risk” 
        may result in better engineering results than a blanket rule that avoids “complex interaction.” “Tight coupling and complex interaction are not always avoidable and perhaps should not always be avoided, but 
        engineers must have the experience and judgment necessary to determine when they can and should be avoided and what precautions [are necessary]” (p. 159). There is an assumption of technical and professional 
        excellence necessary to attain the virtue of risk-sensitivity, thus minimizing the chances of something going awry. An aspirational approach to engineering ethics coupled with risk sensitivity can help highly 
        experienced engineers tackle difficult problems that traditional moral and preventative ethics may have stifled. <br><br>

	    Pure technical excellence is not the only focus of Harris's work. He also brings up techno-social sensitivity and commitment to the public good. This humanistic approach can result in engineering development that 
        can have a profound, positive impact on society. One example that he brings up is boilers in the 19th Century US, which were prone to explosion on steamboats. This resulted in a rigorous examination of boiler 
        construction, with the consensus that thicker walls and safety valves dramatically improved safety. The social benefit from the increased safety was significant, and in 1852 Congress mandated the modifications to 
        boilers. Harris states that “[while] it might be more 'efficient' in some larger sense to build boilers on the old standards, this [is] no longer an option [due to] value dimensions determined by social forces that
         are not immediately apparent” (p. 161). Technology is sensitive to societal change (and vice versa), and while steamboats on their own were a meaningful advancement, the pursuit of boiler safety by engineers and 
         the US Congress caused critical design changes that saved lives. This also underscores that technological development cannot solely focus on efficiency, and that maximizing benefit to society is a multifaceted 
         endeavor where safety, cost, and practicality all play a meaningful role. <br><br>

        Commitment to the public good is another way engineering benefits society, and at its core, has principles of positive psychology. An example of this is Engineers Without Borders (EWB), an organization whose goal 
        is to work on engineering projects in underserved communities. Two of the virtues that Harris talks about, compassion and gratitude, are prevalent in positive psychology and relevant to pro-bono organizations such 
        as EWB. Gratitude has many positive effects associated with it: lower levels of stress, better social integration, and improved academic and professional performance (Lerner & Schelechter, 2017; Westover, 2022). In 
        an official report accessible on their website, EWB shows that many of its volunteers have significantly benefited from their experience, growing both professionally and personally. On average, volunteers reported 
        significant improvement in teamwork and technical and problem-solving skills, as well as project management (Engineers Without Borders, 2021). While the technical report did not discuss specific aspects of positive 
        psychology, I surmise it may have had a positive effect on personal and professional development, and helped participants further develop valuable interpersonal skills. <br><br>

        It is not realistic to expect that all engineering companies would function like EWB (which is uniquely committed to the public good), but the organization highlights some of the benefits of using a positive 
        psychology-oriented approach to the task at hand. In a study done by the American Psychological Association, “almost all employees (93 percent) who reported feeling valued said that they are motivated to do their 
        best at work and 88 percent reported feeling engaged. This compares to just 33 percent and 38 percent, respectively, of those who said they do not feel valued” (APA, 2012). Thus, gratitude is crucial for better 
        performance in any workplace. Other studies on the effects of positive psychology on teamwork have found that “although not traditionally treated as a team level construct, the qualities of an optimist translate well 
        to a team level positive capacity…a team with shared beliefs and expectations regarding the likelihood of positive outcomes is more likely…[to] actively engage in work tasks” (West et al., 2009, p. 253). Similarly, 
        the promotion of resilience by positive psychology is beneficial in a team setting, as it makes a team less likely to give up in case of a setback or failure. In their study, West et al. found that there were significant 
        correlations between both team resilience and optimism, and cohesion, cooperation, coordination, and satisfaction (p. 260-261). Consequently, a positive psychological approach utilizing optimism and resilience can have
         measurable positive effects on group work - something that is common to most engineering jobs. <br><br>
        As a framework, positive psychology offers valuable tools for all engineers (including aspiring ones) - from students to industry professionals. Engineering is a challenging major, and students can benefit from mindfulness
         practice and general, day-to-day wellness. For more seasoned, innovative engineers, aspirational ethics can be the catalyst to further pursue a groundbreaking invention they have been working on. For those in internships
          or industry positions, gratitude, a healthy dose of optimism, and resilience in the face of challenges elevates performance on the individual and team level. Hopefully, positive psychology in engineering can also help
           us find more meaning in our work, be it through public works projects, interpersonal relations, or small innovations that make life a little bit easier. <br><br>

    <details><summary><u>In Pursuit of a Rising Sun (06/15/2023)</u></summary><span>
        It is the start of summer break; the year high school had moved online due to the pandemic. I decided after too many days at home listening to Zoom lectures, and only an occasional walk around the park, that I am ready for a
        dramatic shift in my day-to-day life. Consequently, on the day after my last exam, I woke up at 5 AM, surprisingly refreshed. It was time to make breakfast, start an hour-long trek to the beach to watch the sunrise, test the
        waters, and get some exercise in. By the time I got home at 10 in the morning, I had walked almost as much as I did in a week during that spring semester. Unfortunately, it was through a slow and conscious week-by-week process
        that I found myself pushing the time that I end up going to sleep: from 9:30, to 10, to midnight. Around a month after I started my new schedule, waking up at 5:00 became physically impossible. My hand, in a near Pavlovian
        response, gravitated toward the snooze button the second the alarm began to ring. As Zoom school commenced once again in the fall, I was back at my spring semester routine of barely waking up at 7:30 - the absolute latest 
        time when I can get through my morning routine and then rush to the computer to settle in for my class at 8. <br><br>

        As semesters and summers have gone by, I have contemplated how I could restore a good sleep schedule. The benefits are clear: adequate sleep is critical for a healthy immune system, better hormonal balance and blood sugar levels,
        and many other physical health factors; while sleep disruption contributes to all major psychiatric conditions (Walker, 2017). Yet molding my brain to attain my desired sleep schedule has proven difficult, in part due to the 
        multifaceted nature of the problem. I need to generate a consistent routine, create a sleep-conducive environment, and maintain my motivation. Ultimately, I want to change my brain to build up good habits more effectively, 
        dismantle bad ones, and to always wake up in time to see the sunrise. <br><br>

        Norman Doidge has some insight on how a plasticity-oriented approach can result in good outcomes by stopping bad habits. In his book The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science,
        one chapter focuses on Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz's treatment for OCD. It “helps not only those with obsessive-compulsive disorder but also those of us with more everyday worries … [and can help us] when we become compulsive and 
        driven by such "nasty habits" as compulsive nail biting, hair pulling, shopping, gambling, and eating” (p. 119-120). One “nasty habit” behind my shifting sleep schedule is checking my phone for no reason, and especially using
        it right before I sleep. It is difficult to put it away when there is always a 'next' message, video, or email, and it is extremely easy to get caught up in just scrolling. From a physiological standpoint, using phones before 
        bed is detrimental to sleep quality. Receptors in the eye detect the blue LEDs, which are found in smartphones and computers, signal 'daylight' to the brain, which suppresses melatonin release and leads to a worse quality of 
        sleep (Walker, 2017). Schwartz suggests 'manual transmission,' effectively refocusing on a different activity when OCD (or in my instance, a bad habit) comes up. The inherent struggle is not giving into indulging the obsession 
        (Doidge, 2007). A feasible implementation of this in my life would be to further cut down on phone use, regardless of what time of day it is. Doidge emphasizes that “with obsessions and compulsions, the more you do it, the more 
        you want to do it; the less you do it, the less you want to do it” (p. 123). Thus, cutting down on my phone use may make it easier to simply resist the compulsion to check it before I go to sleep, and avoid it by reflecting 
        about my day, meditating, or adding a new entry to my gratitude journal instead. <br><br>

        In pursuing a better sleep schedule, consistency is the name of the game. It is not only necessary to routinely cut out phone use and other factors that diminish sleep quality (such as caffeine at night), but to also build up 
        new habits. In Atomic Habits by James Clear, he states that “habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.… [Dopamine] is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it” (p. 91). In my case, the 
        anticipation is getting a good night's sleep and waking up well rested, nice and early. It was that combination of anticipation and reward that kept up my good sleep schedule that summer (for a couple of weeks). A way I can 
        reinforce this habit is through the inclusion of a pre-sleep routine - which should add some rewarding habits and make me less prone to straying away from the schedule. Some of those habits can be a hot shower (where the body 
        temperature drop can help induce sleepiness), or some relaxing activities like reading or listening to music (Walker, 2017). If I regularly set aside time at the end of the day for those activities, maintaining a rigid sleep 
        schedule should be considerably easier, due to the dopamine release associated with them. In addition, due to neuroplasticity, the longer I keep up the habits, the easier they will become; to the point where I can sit down and 
        meditate, read, write in my journal, or draw because I would have gotten used to doing it every day. <br><br>

        On a tangential note, I can further develop my neuroplasticity and habit building before heading to sleep by curating what I choose to read. According to Doidge (2007), “when an animal is motivated to learn, the brain responds 
        plastically” (p. 52). By reading research articles and scientific literature that I'm interested in before heading to bed, I can try and strike a balance between focused learning and relaxation (as I do not want to become so 
        stimulated that I mess up the schedule). Perhaps it may help further reinforce the pre-bed routine, and I'll learn some new things along the way. Selecting what I read can also help with motivation and keeping myself on track. 
        If it is a longer book that I find intriguing, I'll be excited to get back to reading it during the day. <br><br>

        A better quality of sleep will keep my motivation up and is critical to not waking up groggily. One of the foundations of proper sleep hygiene is regular exercise during the day (as in the evening, it can elevate alertness and 
        make it harder to fall asleep). Walker (2017) states that “in younger, healthy adults, exercise frequently increases total sleep time, especially deep NREM sleep. It also deepens the quality of sleep, resulting in more powerful 
        electrical brainwave activity” and “when sleep was poor the night prior, exercise intensity and duration were far worse the following day” (p. 213). This parallels my experience during the summer of 2020, where my trek to the 
        beach and back was easy and enjoyable, until my sleep schedule was thrown off, at which point it became somewhat of a chore. It is also an important reminder that a sedentary lifestyle is not very compatible with a healthy 
        sleep schedule. <br><br>

        As I start to work back towards going to sleep at 9:30 and waking up at 5, I'll keep in mind that I need to bring back the early morning beach walk or a brief nature trail hike. The effects of regular exercise stretch beyond a 
        good sleep schedule. Doidge (2007) writes “[physical] activity is helpful not only because it creates new neurons but because the mind is based in the brain, and the brain needs oxygen. [Cardiovascular] exercise strengthens 
        the heart and the blood vessels that supply the brain and helps people who engage in these activities feel mentally sharper” (p. 179). In a way, this is a positive feedback loop, which should be extremely effective at habit 
        building. Walker claims that a full night of sleep results in “wakefulness with physical vigor and sharp brain function” (p. 32) - this bidirectionality and 'symbiosis' between sleep and exercise can help create a routine that 
        is self-sustaining. <br><br>

        I believe that by utilizing my brain's neuroplasticity, I can make quick and effective progress in my goal to attain a healthy sleep schedule. Whilst writing this essay, I've begun working on decreasing my time spent on electronics, 
        and hopefully blue LEDs at night will no longer interfere with my sleep. There is still work to be done - I need to start implementing a more thorough pre-bedtime routine, exercise a bit more, and see if reading research papers and 
        engaging textbooks before sleeping is an effective way for me to both learn and unwind. While these habits take time to build up and I need to consciously put in an effort to preserve them, the reward of better health, more energy, 
        and a sharper mind is a great motivator. I hope that by July, I will once again wake up at 5, enjoy a healthy breakfast, and walk to the beach to watch the sunrise. This time around, I will ensure to make it more permanent. <br><br>
